= Lua Notes = 
  * To print an expression simply use _print("")_ Where "" contains a statement or variable
  * Lua chunks can be any piece of code that is a single statement or a bunch of functions and statements.
  * Lua interpreter can be ran by running lua in a terminal. Scripts can be ran by simply running lua followed by the script name(Prfer to end in _.lua_) 
  * Expressions can be simply typed into the interpreter but older versions required a _=_ before each expression
  * You can run a script and then enter interactive mode by using _lua -i_ 
  * You can run scripts while inside interactive mode by using _dofile("")_
  * For identifiers(variable or function names) they can be any string with letters and underscores, but cannot begin with a digit
  * Reserved words: _and, break, do, else, elseif, then, true, or, while_ can not be identifiers
  * Comments are started by an _--_  
    - Multi line commenets are started and eneded  by --[[ 
                                                    ]]
    - A piece of code can commented out by --[[ 
                                         _print("example")_ 
                                          --]] 
    - The code can be uncommented by ---[[
                                    _print("example")_ 
                                      --]] 
  === Idioms === 
    * x = x or v
      - _if not x then x = v_ 
    * ((a and b) or c)                               1          2    3   
      - there are three operands in this statement: _(x > y) and x or y_ 
      - If the first expression of and(boolean) is true, then the second expression of and is evaluated
      - In Lua integers are always true, thus the second expression is true. The or expression results in the second and expression
      - If the first expression of and is false then the or expression selects y
    * Lua can reads an input _io.read()_
